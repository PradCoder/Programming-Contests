# Programming-Contests
These are some of my solutions to programming contests and answers to textbook solutions. I am still working on fully implementing some useful algorithms for my purposes. This is slowly growing large every year with every book I read and new problems I find. These days I'm doing USACO.

## Competitive Programming Template
I've also newly included a competitive programming template in C++ since it easier than writing everything over and over again.
